### Containerization with Docker

```
git clone https://github.com/badtuxx/giropops-senhas
cd giropops-senhas/
echo "FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /home/nonroot/.local/bin/flask /home/nonroot/.local/bin/flask
COPY . .

ENV PATH=\"/home/nonroot/.local/bin:\$PATH\"
ENTRYPOINT [\"flask\", \"run\", \"--host=0.0.0.0\"]" >> Dockerfile
```

#### Explanation

The containerization process consists of creating a file called “Dockerfile” to create a Docker image. The Dockerfile starts with the ```FROM``` section, there we define what our base image is, which in this project will be a Chainguard Python image, this image was adopted because Chainguard creates images with no vulnerabilities.
```
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev AS builder
```
The ```AS builder``` part means this is a construction step.

When the container starts, what will be the default directory? We answer this question using ```WORKDIR``` which in this case is ```/app```

Now we have a base image and the default directory, but its empty. To solve this, we will ```COPY``` everything from app directory called ```/giropops-senhas``` (The current directory), to our ```WORKDIR``` directory called ```/app```, for do this we will use "COPY period space period": ```COPY . .``` Its means, copy everything from the current directory "/giropops-senhas" to directory defined in ```WORKDIR``` "/app".
