### Containerization with Docker

```
git clone https://github.com/badtuxx/giropops-senhas
cd giropops-senhas/
echo "FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages /home/nonroot/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /home/nonroot/.local/bin/flask /home/nonroot/.local/bin/flask
COPY . .

ENV PATH=\"/home/nonroot/.local/bin:\$PATH\"
ENTRYPOINT [\"flask\", \"run\", \"--host=0.0.0.0\"]" >> Dockerfile
```

#### Explanation

The containerization process consists of creating a file called “Dockerfile” to create a Docker image. The Dockerfile starts with the ```FROM``` section, there we define what our base image is, which in this project will be a Chainguard Python image, this image was adopted because Chainguard creates images with no vulnerabilities.
`
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest-dev AS builder
`
The `AS builder` part means this is a construction step.

When the container starts, what will be the default directory? We answer this question using `WORKDIR` which in this case is `/app`

Now we have a base image and the default directory, but its empty. To solve this, we will `COPY` everything from app directory called `/giropops-senhas` (The current directory), to our `WORKDIR` directory called `/app`, for do this we will use "COPY period space period": `COPY . .` Its means, copy everything from the current directory "/giropops-senhas" to directory defined in `WORKDIR` "/app".

Now that we have our directory with the necessary files, let's run the command that installs the application requirements: `RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`.

`pip install` Is a package installer for Python, to install Python packages

`-- user` This option tells pip to install the packages in the user-level directory instead of the system-wide directory. This is useful when you don't have permission to install packages globally or want to avoid modifying the system Python environment.

`--no-cache-dir` This option prevents pip from saving the downloaded packages in its cache. This reduces the size of the Docker image since the cache isn't stored, which is particularly useful in a containerized environment where minimizing image size is important.

`-r requirements.txt` This option tells pip to install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file. The requirements.txt file is a standard way of specifying a list of Python packages along with their versions.
