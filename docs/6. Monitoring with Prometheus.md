Installing Kube Prometheus

Kube Prometheus is distributed by the Prometheus Operator community. You can install it using the manifests available in the Prometheus Operator repository.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus.git
cd kube-prometheus
```

Apply the namespace creation manifests and CRDs:
```
kubectl create -f manifests/setup
```

Wait until the CRDs are ready by checking their status:
```
kubectl get crds
```

Then, apply the rest of the manifests to install Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager:
```
kubectl create -f manifests/
```

Check the exposed services:
```
kubectl get svc -n monitoring
```

Expose Grafana with Port-Forward:
```
k port-forward -n monitoring svc/grafana 33000:3000
```

Expose Prometheus with Port-Forward:
```
k port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-k8s 39090:9090
```

Expose Alertmanager with Port-Forward:
```
k port-forward -n monitoring svc/alertmanager-main 39393:9393
```

To see all created ServiceMonitor, simply run the following command:
```
k get servicemonitor -n monitoring
```

To see the contents of a ServiceMonitor, simply run the following command:
```
kubectl get servicemonitor prometheus-k8s -n monitoring -o yaml
```

```
k get customresourcedefinitions
```
