Installing Kube Prometheus

Kube Prometheus is distributed by the Prometheus Operator community. You can install it using the manifests available in the Prometheus Operator repository.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus.git
cd kube-prometheus
```

Apply the namespace creation manifests and CRDs:
```
kubectl create -f manifests/setup
```

Wait until the CRDs are ready by checking their status:
```
kubectl get crds
```

Then, apply the rest of the manifests to install Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager:
```
kubectl create -f manifests/
```

Check the exposed services:
```
kubectl get svc -n monitoring
```

```
k port-forward -n monitoring svc/grafana 3000:3000
```
